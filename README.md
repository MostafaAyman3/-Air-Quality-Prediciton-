# Air Quality Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict air quality based on various environmental factors. It utilizes machine learning models to classify air quality levels, providing insights into pollution trends and their potential impact on public health.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Air Quality Data in India](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india). It contains real-world measurements of pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, and other environmental factors like temperature and humidity.

## Project Structure
- **Data Processing**: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, and feature scaling is performed.
- **Modeling**: The project uses Logistic Regression as the classification model. Techniques such as oversampling (RandomOverSampler) are applied to handle class imbalances.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Air-Quality-Prediction.git
    ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to train the model and make predictions:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Air Quality Prediction.ipynb"
    ```

## Model Deployment
The model is deployed and can be accessed through a web-based application, where users can input environmental data and get real-time air quality predictions.
